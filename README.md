# CS 290 - Exercise Tracker (MERN app) 

This is a full-stack single-page app using the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack, designed for users to track the details of their exercise routine over time. Users can provide a custom name for the exercise, along with the weight (in kg or lb), reps, and date it was completed. Data is saved to a persistent MongoDB backend.

This was the final project for Oregon State's **CS 290 - Web Development**. 

## Usage

The Mongo-based backend is contained in `lambethw_rest/`, while the React-based front end is in `lambethw_react/`. To start the app, run `npm install` followed by `npm start` in each of these directories; this will run a local development server and launch a browser window where you can interact with the app directly.
